# Flapjack Octopus

## Finding Ready-Made Assets

3D modeling can be a fun but very difficult and slow process. To expedite your workflow, it can be helpful to download ready-made assets created by others. One valuable resource for accessing a vast collection of high-quality 3D models is Sketchfab, an online repository where artists from various industries, including gaming, movies, and architectural visualization, can showcase and share their 3D creations. On Sketchfab, you'll find a diverse range of models spanning characters, creatures, environments, and objects, allowing you to leverage existing assets and focus your efforts on assembling and customizing them to suit your specific needs.

Today, we'll be downloading a free asset from Sketchfab. You'll need to have a free Sketchfab account, lucky for you I've already created a shared one for us.

Visit the following link. We'll be using this model for the demo today.

You should see a screen that looks like this. Click the `Download 3D Model` button to download the model.

If prompted with a login page like the one below, select the option to sign in with Google. From here, sign in to the watanabekids12 gmail account. Alternatively, you may use your own account if desired.

Once signed in, click the download button again and you'll see the following list of download options. 

These are different options for file formats. For 3d models, Adobe Aero accepts FBX and GLB files. We will grab the 1k .glb file circled in red below.

For a higher detailed model, you may select the 4k model, but note that higher detail means larger files. In this case, the 4k model is 29 MB, and your Adobe Aero scenes should be under 50 MB total to prevent long loading times.

Now you've got a copy of the model, we can move on.

## Importing Assets

This section will cover how to bring your assets (like the octopus we just downloaded) into your Adobe Aero scene.

First, create a new Adobe Aero project and click the + button in the sidebar on the left, shown below.

You should see a popup window of your filesystem. Find and click the octopus glb file to add it to the scene.

You should see the octopus load in to your view, it will be too large initially. So we will need to resize it.

To scale the model, drag any of the square handles labeled A inwards.

Alternatively, you can specify the exact dimensions of the model by typing in measurements in centimeters at the point labeled B.

Since there's a lock icon next to Size, we can change one dimension, in this case, X, and the others will scale accordingly to preserve the shape of the model.

Set the size of the octopus to be 8cm across in the X dimension.

It should resemble the following screen. Be sure to use your mousewheel to zoom in and out so you can see the model.

Congrats! You've successfully imported a model into Adobe Aero. Now, before we add behaviors, let's preview our octopus and make sure everything went well.

Click the blue share button in the top right corner, shown below.

A window will appear like the one below. Click the blue `Create Link` button.

After loading, a QR code should appear. Scan it and follow the on screen instructions. If the octopus looks appropriately sized to fit in the palm of your hand, everything went well.

If it's too large, try checking the size of the octpus was correctly set to 8 cm, or try scanning a different horizontal surface to anchor.

## Defining Behaviors

Behaviors allow us to make simple animations in response to events. They are the basic building blocks of all movement and interactivity in Aero. 

First, open the Behaviors panel by clicking the running person icon in the bottom left.
