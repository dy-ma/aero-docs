## Finding Ready-Made Assets

3D modeling can be a fun but very difficult and slow process. To expedite your workflow, it can be helpful to download ready-made assets created by others. One valuable resource for accessing a vast collection of high-quality 3D models is Sketchfab, an online repository where artists from various industries, including gaming, movies, and architectural visualization, can showcase and share their 3D creations. On Sketchfab, you'll find a diverse range of models spanning characters, creatures, environments, and objects, allowing you to leverage existing assets and focus your efforts on assembling and customizing them to suit your specific needs.

Today, we'll be downloading a free asset from Sketchfab. You'll need to have a free Sketchfab account, lucky for you I've already created a shared one for us.

Visit the following link. We'll be using this model for the demo today.
